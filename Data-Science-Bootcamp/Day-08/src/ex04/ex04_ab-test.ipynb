    "### Analysis:\n",
    "1.  **Test Group (Saw Newsfeed):**\n",
    "    *   Average time before first visit: **61.16 hours** before deadline.\n",
    "    *   Average time after first visit: **105.23 hours** before deadline.\n",
    "    *   **Improvement:** Students started working **~44 hours earlier** after seeing the newsfeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Control Group (Did NOT see Newsfeed):**\n",
    "    *   Average time \"before\" (virtual): **99.90 hours** before deadline.\n",
    "    *   Average time \"after\" (virtual): **118.14 hours** before deadline.\n",
    "    *   **Improvement:** Students started working **~18 hours earlier** in the second half of the course naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "While both groups showed improvement (likely due to gaining experience or anxiety about tougher deadlines), the **Test Group's improvement (+44h) was more than double that of the Control Group (+18h)**. This suggests that the peer pressure from the Newsfeed successfully motivated students to start their labs significantly earlier."
